## How It Start & What You Can Expect

* I want to write easily and read anywhere.
* I want to change the styles of my pages anytime.
* I want to re-construct my pages freely.
* I want to get complete access control of my posts, and dynamic views with respect to the audiences.
* I want to get rid of ads.
* I want to ...

I want to have so many features, so I build my own website. And I also want to share it with anyone interested and improve it. Try the [current version](http://zhyack.cn). A [demo](http://zhyack.cn:9000) whose codes are completely the same as this repo. If you do like static pages, my [previous blog](https://zhyack.github.io/posts/2015_11_23_How-To-Build-Your-Blog-On-Github-Pages.html) solution may be a good option.

## The Reality

* Current Backend: Django 2.0.2 (Python 3.5)
* Current Frontend: hodgepodge =_=
* Current Editor: [Editor.md](https://github.com/pandao/editor.md)
* Current Features:
    * User register and private space. 
    * Edit and view of posts and files.
    * Enhanced markdown editor to write posts.
    * Authority control (user access control, password control) of posts and files.
    * Post list in the side bar.

## TODO:
* A tutorial and summary of the previous works.
* New Blog model to host blogs.
    * Alternative styles.
    * Self-organized page lists.
* Better editor.
* New Comment model.
* Faster, faster, faster.
* Interactive games between users.

Let's just do it.
